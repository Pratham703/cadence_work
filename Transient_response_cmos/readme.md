# Experiment 4 - Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC) of Resistive-load NMOS Inverter

## 🎯 Aim
To analyze the voltage transfer characteristics (VTC) of a resistive-load NMOS inverter and calculate:
- VOH
- VOL
- VIH
- VIL
- Vth

## 🛠 Tools Required
- PC
- Cadence Tools (Virtuoso, ADE)

## 📐 Circuit Diagram
- Resistive-load NMOS inverter schematic as shown in the manual.

## 📝 Procedure

### 1. Schematic Design
- Open Cadence Virtuoso.
- Create a new library and schematic view for the inverter.
- Add components using the i key (Instance).
- Add pins for vin (input) and vout (output).
- Connect the components using w key (Wire).
- Use Check and Save to validate the design.

### 2. Simulation Setup
- Launch ADE L.
- Go to Analyses → Choose, select *DC analysis*.
- In Outputs → To be plotted → Select on Schematic, click on input and output nets.
- Run the simulation using Simulation → Netlist and Run.

## 📈 Output
- DC Transfer Characteristics curve of the NMOS inverter.
- Determine VOH, VOL, VIH, VIL, and Vth from the curve.

## ✅ Result
Voltage transfer characteristics were simulated successfully and key points (VOH, VOL, VIH, VIL, Vth) were identified from the plot.
